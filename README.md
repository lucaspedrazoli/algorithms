# Big O Notation
Is about how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input.
It is a measure of the performances of the algorithm based on the input.
# Buble Sort  / Time complexity: O(nÂ²)
Just educational. It is always slow. In the best or worst case.
```
extension Array where Element: Comparable {
  func bubbleSort(by areInIncreasingOrder: ((Element, Element)) -
}
